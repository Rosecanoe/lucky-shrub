create a web home page for the client "Lucky Shrub" to attract 2 type customers: who is seeking garden design and who is planning to buy plants. 

## Our Client Persona

Based in Tuscon, Arizona, Lucky Shrub is a medium-sized garden design firm that specializes **in garden design and creation, maintenance and landscaping**. The company also runs a small plant nursery that **sells indoor and outdoor plants**, making them a one-stop shop for clients to "transform any space into an oasis you can be proud of".

Lucky Shrub was started by a husband and wife team, Jason and Maria, who share a long-time love for plants. Jason is the garden architect. He creates and oversees all designs while managing his team of landscapers. Maria manages all the marketing for the company and oversees the nursery.

## Demand analysis

There should be two path to show that whether a client needs:

1.a single garden design service

2.just need to buy plants

3.need a one-stop shop from garden design to physically plants

 ## Solution

### layout

Our client would love to have a tranditional concise home to show it's spriit and attract customers for its service. Our client also ask a cost-effective plan. So a classical layout plan is the best one. 

1.logo

2.header->nav

3.main -> slogan/three showcase

4.footer -> logo/copyright

### color theme

Since our client's sprit is about nature and plants. The classical green theme is an excellent choice. We also choose a classical theme for our client:

Logo Green:#27877F

Yellow: #FCBF05

Dark: #272727

 Light: #E7E3D5

### animation

For attracting customers, a good method is to add box-shadow when a mouse hover on the section.

## Development log

### a failure try 

As it is a course project, I forgot to write the demand analysis and just jump into the coding project. Then I found that I lack some important messages needs to be shown on the page. So I have to re-write the page. I decide to stop and write demand analysis first. 

This time I begin to write this readme.md and also use pen and paper to draw the layout. It makes me feel better. The experience is that I need to think about clearly then began to write coding, or I would lose into the labyrinthos.
